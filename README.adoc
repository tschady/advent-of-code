## Introduction
My Clojure solutions to the https://adventofcode.com[Advent of Code] challenge over multiple years.

## Don't make your inputs public!

.Plea from creator of AOC:
[quote, Eric Wastl]
If you're posting a code repository somewhere, please don't include parts of Advent of Code like the puzzle text or your inputs.

To aid anyone else that may have already published their inputs, I wrote link:ENCRYPT.adoc[this guide] on how to transparently encrypt your inputs and purge older public copies.
